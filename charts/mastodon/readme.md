# Introduction

This is a [Helm](https://helm.sh/) chart for installing Mastodon into a
Kubernetes cluster.

# Configuration

The variables that _must_ be configured are:

- `ingress.hostname`; even if you arenâ€™t using an Ingress, this value is used to
  set `LOCAL_DOMAIN`.

- password and keys in the `secrets`, `postgresql`, and `redis` groups; if
  left blank, some of those values will be autogenerated, but will not persist
  across upgrades.

- SMTP settings for your mailer in the `smtp` group.


# Changes

These are the changes from the chart in the [official repo](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/tree/main/chart).

1. Remove persistence from redis and postgres.
2. Disable elastic search.
